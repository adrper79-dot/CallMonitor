## Executive Summary

Word Is Bond operates at the intersection of two massive, converging markets: **AI-powered contact center software** ($56.9B in 2026, growing 21.9% CAGR) and **U.S. debt collection** ($13.6B in 2026, ~5,467 agencies). The platform's unique positioning — collections-specific, AI-native, compliance-first, edge-deployed — targets an underserved segment: small-to-mid-size collection agencies (10–200 agents) that need modern voice intelligence but can't afford or stomach enterprise CCaaS contracts.

**Key findings:**

1. **Market timing is optimal.** SMEs adopt CCaaS at the fastest clip (19.3% CAGR), and collection agencies are tech-upgrading after post-pandemic revenue compression
2. **No direct competitor** combines real-time voice AI + integrated telephony + compliance automation + no-contract pricing in a single lightweight platform
3. **Regulatory tailwinds** favor compliance-first vendors — CFPB enforcement of Reg F creates demand for automated guardrails that most incumbents don't provide
4. **TAM → SOM path** yields a $32M Serviceable Obtainable Market within 3 years at current pricing
5. **Unit economics** are favorable: ~$300/mo base cost, $29–99/seat pricing, gross margins >75%

## 1. Market Sizing: TAM → SAM → SOM

### 1.1 Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Market Layer | 2026 Value | CAGR | 2030 Projection | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Global Contact Center Software | $56.9B | 21.9% | $130B+ | Grand View Research |
| Global Cloud CCaaS | $85.0B | 16.7% | $184.2B (2031) | Mordor Intelligence |
| U.S. Contact Center (36.4% of global) | $20.7B | ~20% | ~$47B | Derived |
| U.S. Debt Collection Industry | $13.6B | Recovering | ~$15B+ | IBISWorld |
| BFSI Vertical CC Software | ~$11.5B | 17.8% | ~$25B | Mordor (BFSI share) |

**TAM** = U.S. Contact Center Software for BFSI + Collections = **~$12B**

### 1.2 Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

Word Is Bond targets SMB/mid-market collection agencies using or evaluating cloud contact center solutions.

| Filter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. debt collection agencies | 5,467 | IBISWorld (2025) |
| Agencies with 10–200 agents (ICP) | ~2,700 (est. 50%) | Industry estimates |
| Avg. annual tech spend per agency | $120K–$480K | $100–$400/seat × 100 seats × 12 months |
| Cloud-ready / evaluating CCaaS | ~65% | Mordor (cloud adoption rate in SME) |
| **SAM (ICP agencies × avg. tech spend)** | **~$210M–$840M** | |

**SAM midpoint** = **~$420M/year** (2,700 agencies × $155K avg. annual spend)

### 1.3 Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) — 3-Year

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target customers | 15 | 60 | 200 |
| Avg. seats per customer | 25 | 35 | 45 |
| Avg. price/seat/month | $69 | $79 | $89 |
| **Annual Recurring Revenue** | **$310K** | **$2.0M** | **$9.6M** |
| Cumulative customers | 15 | 75 | 275 |
| **Cumulative ARR** | **$310K** | **$2.3M** | **$11.9M** |

Conservative assumptions: 5–8% capture of SAM by Year 3, accounting for ramp-up, churn (~15%/year for SMB SaaS), and pricing evolution.

## 2. Industry Analysis

### 2.1 U.S. Debt Collection Industry

| Dimension | Data |
|---|---|
| Market Size (2026) | $13.6B revenue |
| Number of Agencies | 5,467 (declining at -3.5% CAGR 2020–2025) |
| Revenue Trend (5yr) | Declined at -6.3% CAGR (post-pandemic effects) |
| Forecast (5yr) | Expected to grow (IBISWorld) |
| Market Concentration | Moderate and decreasing |
| Largest Players | Alorica Inc., Encore Capital Group |
| Regulatory Pressure | High — CFPB Reg F (§1006), TCPA, FDCPA, state mini-CFPB acts |

**What this means for Word Is Bond:** The industry is consolidating around tech-forward agencies. Smaller agencies that don't adopt AI and compliance automation will either close or get acquired. This creates a natural upgrade cycle — exactly the moment to offer a modern, affordable alternative to legacy dialers.

### 2.2 Contact Center Software Industry

| Dimension | Data |
|---|---|
| Global Market (2026) | $56.9B (Grand View) / $85.0B (Mordor) |
| U.S. Share | 36.4% of global ($20.7B–$33.6B) |
| CAGR | 16.7–21.9% through 2031–2033 |
| Cloud Deployment Share | 74.2% of spend (2025), rising |
| SME Growth Rate | 19.3% CAGR — fastest segment |
| GenAI Agent Share | 18.4% of market, highest CAGR |
| Top 5 Concentration | ~45% (Genesys, NICE, Five9, Cisco, AWS) |
| Key Trigger | Compliance-ready AI capabilities drive purchase decisions in regulated verticals |

**What this means for Word Is Bond:** The $55B+ headroom and moderate concentration leave significant room for vertical specialists. SMEs adopt fastest, and collections is a vertical where generic CCaaS consistently underdelivers on compliance.

## 4. Market Trends & Drivers

### 4.1 Macro Trends Favoring Word Is Bond

| Trend | Impact | WIB Alignment |
|---|---|---|
| **GenAI in contact centers** | 18.4% of market, fastest CAGR | ✅ AI transcription, sentiment, copilot, scoring built in |
| **Cloud-first CCaaS** | 74% of new spend is cloud | ✅ 100% cloud-native on Cloudflare edge |
| **SME adoption surge** | 19.3% CAGR, fastest segment | ✅ Priced and designed for SME ($29–$99/seat) |

| **Industry consolidation** | Smaller agencies close or upgrade | ✅ Low-cost modernization path for upgraders |
| **CFPB enforcement** | Reg F violations carry $50K+ per-incident fines | ✅ Automated guardrails prevent violations |

### 4.2 Headwinds & Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Collection industry revenue decline** (-6.3% CAGR 2020–2025) | Medium | Trend reversing; tech spend increases even as agencies consolidate |
| **Enterprise competitors moving downmarket** | Medium | Incumbents have 6-month sales cycles and $75+/seat minimums — structural disadvantage in SME |
| **Autonomous AI displacing human agents** | Low (near-term) | WIB's notary/stenographer model is defensible: agencies want AI assistance, not replacement |
| **Telnyx dependency** | Low | Voice provider can be swapped; core value is in the intelligence layer |
| **Regulatory uncertainty on AI in collections** | Medium | AI-as-observer model (no autonomous action) is the safest regulatory posture |

### 4.3 Regulatory Tailwinds

| Regulation | Enforcement Status | WIB Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Reg F (§1006)** | CFPB active enforcement; 7-in-7 rule, time-of-day, attorney blocks | ✅ 37 mapped requirements, automated pre-dial gates |
| **TCPA** | FCC robocall crackdown redirecting outbound investment | ✅ Consent tracking, DNC management, calling hours |
| **FDCPA** | Mini-Miranda disclosure tracking becoming standard | ✅ Automated tracking in call flows |
| **State mini-CFPB acts** | CA, NY, IL expanding consumer protections | ✅ Extensible compliance engine for per-state rules |
| **EU AI Act** | Mandates "human oversight" for AI in customer interactions | ✅ AI-as-notary inherently satisfies human-in-the-loop requirement |

## 5. Strategic Positioning (SWOT)

### Strengths
1. **Only platform** combining AI + dialer + telephony + compliance in single solution
2. **Price leadership** — 50–85% below enterprise CCaaS at $29–$99/seat/mo
3. **Self-serve onboarding** — no "contact sales" gatekeeping (Stripe billing)
4. **Edge-first architecture** — Cloudflare Workers = sub-50ms latency, sub-$300/mo base cost
5. **AI-as-notary** model — defensible position as agencies fear autonomous AI liability
6. **12-provider integration suite** — HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, Pipedrive, QuickBooks, Google, Outlook, Zendesk, Freshdesk, Slack, Teams, Zapier
7. **Reg F compliance engine** — 37 mapped regulatory requirements with automated enforcement
8. **Modern stack** — Next.js 15 + Hono 4.7 + Neon PG 17 ships features faster than legacy vendors

### Weaknesses
1. **Pre-revenue** — no production customers yet; unproven market fit
2. **Single-founder** — engineering velocity depends on one person
3. **No mobile app** — PWA planned but not yet built
4. **English-only** — Spanish call translation exists, but UI is English-only
5. **No SOC 2 certification** — tracking dashboard exists, but formal audit not completed
6. **Brand awareness** — zero market presence vs. established competitors

### Opportunities
1. **Post-pandemic tech refresh** — 5,467 agencies, many still on legacy dialers
2. **Reg F enforcement wave** — CFPB creating urgency for compliance automation
3. **HubSpot/Salesforce marketplace** — app listings drive organic inbound
4. **Zapier ecosystem** — 5M+ users searching for voice tools
5. **Performance-based pricing tier** — align with Skit.ai model to derisk adoption
6. **Inbound IVR expansion** — 10x TAM expansion from "outbound tool" to "full CCaaS"
7. **Vertical expansion** — Insurance, real estate, financial services share compliance DNA
8. **API platform play** — voice data + webhooks + exports create switching costs

### Threats
1. **NICE/Genesys SMB push** — enterprise vendors reducing minimum seat requirements
2. **Skit.ai autonomous agents** — if agencies prefer fully automated collection
3. **TCN pricing** — incumbent with similar no-contract model and deeper collections DNA
4. **Regulatory overreach** — if CFPB restricts AI use in collections entirely
5. **Telnyx stability** — telephony partner risk (mitigated by abstraction layer)

---

## 6. Go-to-Market Strategy

### 6.1 Beachhead: SMB Collection Agencies (10–50 agents)

**Why this segment first:**
- Highest pain: paying $150+/seat for NICE/Genesys but only using 30% of features
- Most underserved: enterprise vendors ignore <50 seat deals
- Fastest adoption: no procurement committee, owner makes buying decision in days
- Highest word-of-mouth density: ARM industry conferences, ACA International chapters

### 6.2 Customer Acquisition Channels

| Channel | Priority | Cost/Lead | Expected Conversion |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Content marketing** (compliance guides, Reg F checklists) | P0 | $5–15 | 3–5% |
| **ACA International events** (ARM industry conferences) | P0 | $50–100 | 8–12% |
| **HubSpot / Salesforce marketplace** | P1 | $0 (organic) | 2–4% |
| **Product Hunt launch** | P1 | $0 | 1–2% |
| **LinkedIn outbound** (agency owners / compliance officers) | P1 | $20–40 | 4–6% |
| **Zapier marketplace** | P2 | $0 (organic) | 1–2% |
| **Referral program** (existing customers → peers) | P2 | $0–50 credit | 10–15% |
| **Comparison page SEO** ("TCN alternative", "NICE CXone alternative") | P2 | $10–25 | 5–8% |

### 6.3 Pricing Strategy

| Tier | Seats | Price | Features | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter** | 1–10 | $29/seat/mo | Voice, transcription, basic compliance, CRM | Solo collectors, small shops |
| **Professional** | 11–50 | $69/seat/mo | + Dialer, sentiment, AI coaching, campaigns, omnichannel | Growth agencies |
| **Business** | 51–200 | $99/seat/mo | + Live translation, scorecards, QuickBooks, analytics export | Mid-market agencies |
| **Enterprise** | 200+ | Custom | + SOC 2 dashboard, SLA, dedicated support, SSO | Large agencies |

**Why this works:**
- Starter ($29) undercuts every competitor by 2–5x → top of funnel
- Professional ($69) is the volume tier → best unit economics
- Business ($99) captures expansion revenue as agencies grow
- All tiers: no contract, cancel anytime → eliminates procurement friction

### 6.4 Sales Motion

```
Week 1-4:   Self-serve signup → free trial (14 days) → auto-convert to Starter
Month 2-3:  Customer success outreach → demo Business tier features → upsell
Month 4-6:  Usage milestone triggers → automated upgrade recommendations
Ongoing:    Quarterly business reviews for Professional+ customers
```

**Key metric targets:**
- Trial → paid conversion: >15%
- Monthly churn: <5%
- Net Revenue Retention: >110% (seat expansion drives growth)
- Time-to-value: <30 minutes (first call with AI transcription)
