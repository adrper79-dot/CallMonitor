# LAW — Return-Traffic Intelligence (RTI)

## 1. Return-Traffic Intelligence (RTI) — Architecture Section

### Purpose

Return-Traffic Intelligence (RTI) is the **post-execution attention routing layer** of the platform.

RTI exists to **reduce noise**, **compress outcomes**, and **route human attention** after execution has completed. It does not initiate execution, modify canonical artifacts, or declare outcomes.

> RTI optimizes for the **absence of interruption**, not the presence of activity.

---

### Position in the Architecture

RTI sits **after canonical artifacts are finalized** and **before humans are notified**.

```
Execution (SignalWire)
→ Canonical Artifacts (calls, recordings, transcripts, evidence)
→ Intelligence Layers (scoring, surveys, alerts)
→ Return-Traffic Intelligence (RTI)
→ Human Attention / Notifications
```

RTI consumes artifacts; it does not influence execution.

---

### Authority Boundary (Non-Negotiable)

RTI **MUST NOT**:

* initiate calls, campaigns, or schedules
* modify execution state or configuration
* mutate canonical artifacts
* declare agreements, intent, or commitments
* act as a workflow or automation engine

RTI **MAY**:

* summarize events
* suppress noise
* escalate attention
* generate digests
* recommend review (non-authoritative)

RTI outputs are **derived, advisory, and non-authoritative**.

---

### Data Model (Conceptual)

RTI operates through three immutable, append-only artifact types:

1. **Attention Events**
   Normalized “return traffic” signals emitted after execution
   (e.g., call completed, alert triggered, delivery failed)

2. **Attention Decisions**
   Derived judgments applied to events
   (`escalate | suppress | include_in_digest | needs_review`)

3. **Digests**
   Periodic summaries of decisions (e.g., overnight brief)

All RTI artifacts:

* are append-only
* include provenance (`input_refs`)
* include actor attribution
* are org-scoped and RLS-protected

---

### Explainability Requirement

Every RTI decision to **escalate** or **suppress** must include:

* the policy or rule applied
* the evidence references used
* a human-readable reason

If RTI cannot explain a decision, it must default to **needs_review**.

---

### Human Agency Gate

RTI may recommend attention routing, but **any external side effect** (notification, CRM note, webhook) requires:

* an explicit, human-authored policy
* an audit log entry

RTI drafts; humans authorize.

---

### Anti-Sprawl Clause

RTI is a **layer**, not a product.

RTI must not introduce:

* a new tool category
* a parallel execution surface
* feature-specific navigation

RTI surfaces appear only within existing dashboards and reports.

---

### Success Criterion

RTI is successful when:

* nothing wakes a human unnecessarily
* silence is explainable
* attention is earned, not triggered

---

## 2. Definition of Silence — Metric Specification

### Definition of Silence

**Silence** is an explicit, measurable outcome indicating that RTI correctly suppressed non-actionable return traffic.

Silence is not absence of data.
Silence is **intentional non-interruption with explanation**.

---

### Core Metrics

#### 1. Silence Rate

**Definition:**
Percentage of attention events that result in **no human interruption**.

```
Silence Rate =
  suppressed_events / total_attention_events
```

Target (v1): **≥ 85%**

---

#### 2. Explainable Silence Coverage

**Definition:**
Percentage of suppressed events that include an explicit reason and policy reference.

```
Explainable Silence =
  suppressed_events_with_reason / suppressed_events
```

Target: **100%**

Any unexplained suppression is a failure.

---

#### 3. Unnecessary Escalation Rate

**Definition:**
Escalations that are acknowledged by humans but later marked as “non-actionable.”

```
Unnecessary Escalations =
  acknowledged_but_no_action / total_escalations
```

Target: **≤ 5%**

This is the *alert fatigue* indicator.

---

#### 4. Morning Clean Slate Score

**Definition:**
Percentage of digests where:

* no escalations occurred overnight
* or escalations were already resolved

This is a **positive success signal**, not inactivity.

---

### Forbidden Metrics (Explicitly Disallowed)

RTI **must not** optimize for:

* number of alerts sent
* number of digests generated
* number of escalations
* engagement with notifications

Volume is not value.

---

### Product Principle

> If nothing important happened, the correct output is silence —
> and the system must be able to explain why.

---

## 3. v1 RTI Policy Starter Pack

These are **opinionated, constrained policies** designed to work immediately without user scripting.

---

### Policy 1 — Quiet Hours Suppression

**Name:** Quiet Hours
**Intent:** Prevent unnecessary interruptions during off-hours.

**Rule:**

* During configured quiet hours:

  * suppress all non-critical events
  * allow only explicit severity ≥ critical

**Decision:**

* `suppress` → include in next digest

**Reason Template:**

> Suppressed due to quiet hours policy. No critical threshold met.

---

### Policy 2 — Recurring Noise Suppression

**Name:** Recurring Event Suppression
**Intent:** Eliminate known, repetitive noise.

**Rule:**

* If the same event type + source occurs ≥ N times within M hours
* and has never led to escalation or action
* suppress subsequent occurrences

**Decision:**

* `suppress`

**Reason Template:**

> Suppressed as recurring, historically non-actionable event.

---

### Policy 3 — Escalation Threshold

**Name:** Escalation Threshold
**Intent:** Ensure real issues break through silence.

**Rule:**

* Escalate if:

  * severity ≥ configured threshold
  * OR evidence completeness is degraded
  * OR failure blocks downstream processing

**Decision:**

* `escalate`

**Reason Template:**

> Escalated due to severity exceeding configured threshold.

---

### Policy 4 — Ambiguity Guardrail

**Name:** Uncertain Outcome Review
**Intent:** Prevent silent failure when confidence is low.

**Rule:**

* If confidence < threshold
* OR conflicting signals detected

**Decision:**

* `needs_review`

**Reason Template:**

> Flagged for review due to insufficient confidence.

---

### Policy Ordering (v1 Default)

Policies are evaluated in this order:

1. Escalation Threshold
2. Ambiguity Guardrail
3. Quiet Hours
4. Recurring Suppression

First decisive match wins.

---

## v1 Design Constraint

Policies are:

* human-readable
* explainable in one sentence
* versioned, not edited
* admin-authored only

No free-form logic in v1.
