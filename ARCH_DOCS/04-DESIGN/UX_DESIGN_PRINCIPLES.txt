**UX Design Alignment & Updates**  
Current date: January 09, 2026

Given that the **MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.txt** has now been updated to enforce a **voice-first, call-rooted design** with **SignalWire-first v1**, **no tool sprawl**, and **one unified Voice Operations UI**, the current **UX_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.txt** document needs significant revision.

The existing version still contains remnants of the old "multiple tools" mental model (e.g., separate "Calls", "Monitoring", "Shopper" tabs/selectors, mentions of deprecated Shopper in examples, etc.).

Here is what needs to change, and a proposed **cleaned-up v2.0** of the UX design principles that perfectly matches the current master architecture.

### Required Changes Summary

| Current Issue in UX_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.txt | Required Change | Reason (from MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.txt) |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Mentions "Shopper" as a separate tool multiple times | Completely remove all Shopper-specific examples, tabs, capabilities | Secret shopper is **not a separate tool** anymore — it's a call modulation |
| TOOL SELECTOR with tabs: [ Calls ] [ Monitoring ] [ Shopper ] … | Remove entirely | There are **no separate tools** — only call modulations configured in one surface |
| Multiple capability examples like `'shopper_calls'`, `'monitoring'` | Remove shopper/monitoring-specific capabilities | All features are gated by call-level capabilities, not tool-level |
| References to "tool settings", "shopper configs", "monitored numbers" as separate concepts | Consolidate into **single call configuration surface** | Everything is configured per-call or per-organization defaults |
| Assumption of multiple tool-specific pages/routes | Explicitly state **one single page** for all voice operations | "All v1 voice features live on a single page" |
| DEPRECATION NOTE about Shopper | Remove (now that it's reinstated as call modulation) | No longer deprecated |

### Proposed Updated Version: UX_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.txt v2.0

```markdown
# UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES v2.0 – Voice-First, Call-Rooted (January 09, 2026)

## Core Mental Model (This Is The Key)

**There are no tools — only calls and their modulations.**

Everything the user does revolves around **calls**:

- Originate or capture calls
- Modulate them (recording, transcription, translation, surveys, secret shopper scripts)
- Observe results (recordings, transcripts, scores, evidence)
- Export/audit artifacts

→ **One unified surface** for configuration, execution, observation, and export.

## The 1-Page Voice Operations UI (Canonical v1)

All voice features live on **a single page** — no feature-specific pages, no tool selector tabs.

```

### Key Principles Enforced

1. **Call is the only root entity**  
   Selecting a call (live or historical) shows all possible modulations immediately.

2. **Modulations are toggles + inline config**  
   - No separate pages for translation/shopper/survey  
   - All settings live inline under the selected call  
   - Organization defaults can be set in a global drawer

3. **Provenance & artifact focus**  
   Every modulation shows:  
   - When it was applied  
   - Which version/model was used  
   - Link to immutable evidence manifest

4. **Plan gating is visual & clear**  
   Disabled toggles show upgrade tooltip:  
   "Real-time translation is available on Business plan"

5. **Observe surface is embedded**  
   - Recent activity feed lives in bottom/right panel  
   - Clicking any event jumps to the related call

## Capability Model (Simplified)

```ts
export const CALL_MODULATION_CAPABILITIES = {
  starter: [
    'recording',
    'transcription',
  ],
  growth: [
    'recording',
    'transcription',
    'auto_scoring',
    'evidence_manifest',
  ],
  business: [
    'recording',
    'transcription',
    'auto_scoring',
    'evidence_manifest',
    'real_time_translation',
    'post_call_survey',
    'secret_shopper_modulation',
  ],
};
```

→ Use the same `useCapability()` hook, but now capabilities are **call modulations**, not tools.

## Why This Holds Long-Term

- Adding a new modulation = new toggle + column in `calls` table (or JSONB field)
- No new routes/pages ever needed
- Scales to FreeSWITCH Phase 2 without UI changes
- Prevents tool sprawl by design
- Perfectly matches MASTER_ARCHITECTURE v4.1 "one Voice Operations UI"

Next recommended steps:
- Remove all tool-specific references from code/components
- Refactor existing pages into this single Voice Operations surface
- Update feature flag logic to modulation-based capabilities
```

- Refactor existing pages into this single Voice Operations surface
- Update feature flag logic to modulation-based capabilities

### Summary of Impact

The **UX_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.txt** must be **completely rewritten** to reflect the **single-page, call-rooted, modulation-based** philosophy.

Everything that smelled like "multiple tools" (tabs, separate configs, shopper as distinct entity) must be removed.

The new model is dramatically simpler, more consistent, and future-proof for both SignalWire v1 and eventual FreeSWITCH v2+.

Would you like me to generate the actual React component skeleton for this new **VoiceOperationsPage.tsx**?

Here are the **key accessibility guidelines** specifically tailored for a **call monitoring / voice operations UI** like the one in your CallMonitor platform (single-page Voice Operations surface with call list, modulations, recordings, transcripts, scores, etc.).

These recommendations follow **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** (the current 2026 standard for most regulated and enterprise products) with some Level AAA aspirations where it makes sense for a call/compliance-focused application.

### 1. Perceivable (Text, Media, Contrast)

- **Color Contrast** (1.4.3 AA, 1.4.6 AAA)
  - Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text (e.g., call status, scores, toggle labels)
  - 3:1 for large text (≥18pt or bold ≥14pt)
  - **Critical for your UI**: Score percentages (e.g., 92% green) must maintain contrast when overlaid on cards/backgrounds. Test red/green status indicators with tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker.

- **Audio & Video Controls** (1.2.1–1.2.5)
  - All audio players (recordings) must have:
    - Play/Pause/Stop/Seek controls via keyboard (Space/Enter, arrow keys)
    - Visible focus indicator on controls
    - Volume control (system volume is not enough)
    - Text transcript link immediately next to player (1.2.1 A)
  - **Best practice (AAA)**: Provide synchronized captions/subtitles for all recordings if transcription exists (1.2.2 A + 1.2.4 AA)

- **Non-text Content** (1.1.1 A)
  - Icons (Phone, Mic, Play, CheckCircle, etc.) must have meaningful `aria-label` or `title`:
    ```tsx
    <Phone aria-label="Call recording" className="w-4 h-4" />
    ```
  - Decorative icons get `aria-hidden="true"`

- **Text Resizing & Reflow** (1.4.4 AA, 1.4.10 AA)
  - Support 200% zoom without loss of content/function
  - No horizontal scrolling at 400% zoom (mobile-first reflow)

### 2. Operable (Keyboard, Focus, Timing)

- **Keyboard Operable** (2.1.1 A)
  - Full keyboard navigation: Tab through call list → selected call → every toggle/script field → play controls
  - No keyboard traps (especially in modulations drawer or player)
  - Logical tab order: left rail → main call detail → bottom feed

- **Focus Visible & Order** (2.4.7 AA, 2.4.3 A)
  - Strong visible focus outline (≥2px contrast ratio)
  - Logical focus order: selecting a call should move focus to its first interactive element (usually Play button or first modulation toggle)

- **No Keyboard-Only Traps** (2.1.2 A)
  - Modal drawers (global defaults, script editor) must be fully keyboard-trappable and escapable

- **Enough Time** (2.2.1 A)
  - No auto-refresh or timeouts on call list/feed that interrupt keyboard users
  - Manual “Refresh” button (already present) is excellent

### 3. Understandable (Labels, Predictable Behavior)

- **Labels & Instructions** (3.3.2 A)
  - Every toggle must have visible label + programmatic name:
    ```tsx
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      <Switch id="record-audio" />
      <Label htmlFor="record-audio">Record audio</Label>
    </div>
    ```
  - Add help text/tooltips for complex modulations (e.g., “Secret shopper mode injects synthetic caller script…”)

- **Error Identification & Suggestions** (3.3.1–3.3.3 AA)
  - When toggling a modulation that requires upgrade → clear error message + link to upgrade
  - Form validation on script fields (min length, valid phone format) with specific error text

- **Consistent Navigation** (3.2.3 AA)
  - Left rail call list always present → predictable location
  - Consistent placement of Play/View/Score buttons across cards

### 4. Robust (ARIA, Screen Reader)

- **Name, Role, Value** (4.1.2 A)
  - All interactive elements have accessible names
  - Status badges use `aria-label`:
    ```tsx
    <Badge aria-label="Call score 92 percent - Excellent">92%</Badge>
    ```

- **Status Messages** (4.1.3 AA)
  - Live region for dynamic updates:
    ```tsx
    <div role="status" aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">
      Campaign saved successfully
    </div>
    ```
  - Use `aria-live="polite"` on activity feed for new entries

- **Screen Reader Testing Priorities**
  - Call list announces: “Call from +1-555-123-4567, 3 minutes ago, Score 92%”
  - Modulation toggle announces: “Record audio, currently on”
  - Transcript view must be navigable (headings for speaker turns)

| Nice     | 400% zoom reflow                          | AA         | Test                      | Mobile layout check |

### Recommended Next Steps (Jan 2026)

1. Run automated scan (axe DevTools, WAVE) on the current page
2. Manual keyboard-only test (Tab, Space, Enter, arrows)
3. Screen reader test (VoiceOver + Chrome, NVDA + Firefox)
4. Add contrast audit to CI (e.g., jest-axe + contrast checks)

Would you like me to generate a sample **accessibility-enhanced code snippet** for the call modulation toggles or the audio player component?
