# Agent Quick Card (One Page)

Use this at shift start, during calls, and before shift close.

---

## 1) Start-of-shift (2 minutes)

1. Sign in at https://wordis-bond.com
2. Confirm you can open:
   - `/work/queue`
   - `/work/call`
   - `/accounts`
3. Confirm correct organization context

If any page is missing, stop and ask your admin to verify role/org assignment.

---

## 2) Standard call workflow

1. Open **Work Queue** and select top-priority account
2. Open account in **Call Workspace**
3. Complete outreach
4. Before leaving account, do at least one:
   - Add Note
   - Schedule Callback
   - File Dispute
   - Send Payment Link

Rule: do not leave an interaction undocumented.

---

## 3) Quick Action standards

## Add Note (default action)

Write 3 lines:

- What happened
- Customer response
- Next step + timing

## Schedule Callback

Required:

- Date/time
- Reason

Use when customer asks for later contact.

## File Dispute

Required:

- Dispute type
- Reason/context

Use when customer disputes identity, amount, or obligation.

## Send Payment Link

Required:

- Amount
- Correct account context

Use immediately when customer commits to payment.

---

## 4) End-of-shift quality check

- [ ] Every worked account has a note
- [ ] Every unresolved account has a callback or clear next action
- [ ] Critical accounts are not left without disposition

---

## 5) Light troubleshooting

## Cannot sign in

- Verify URL: `https://wordis-bond.com`
- Retry credentials
- Use password reset
- Ask admin to verify account status

## Missing navigation items

- Usually role or org context
- Ask admin to verify role/org membership

## Quick action opens but does not complete

- Check required fields
- Retry once
- Refresh page and retry
- If repeated, report account ID + action + timestamp

## Payment link did not send

- Check amount and account context
- Retry from call/account workspace
- Ask admin to verify payment configuration

---

## 6) Escalate when

Escalate to manager/admin/support if any persist:

- Repeated access errors (401/403)
- Calls/messages failing across multiple accounts
- Role shell not matching assigned role
- Data mismatch affecting customer handling

Include in escalation message:

- Role
- Organization
- URL/page
- Account ID (if relevant)
- Local timestamp
- Exact steps taken
